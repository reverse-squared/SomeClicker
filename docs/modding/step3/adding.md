Once you have made your mod, you want to export it to a jar file. Then add a file called mod.txt in your jar containing four, comma-separated values.
```csv
<Game Version>,<Mod Name>,<Mod Version>,<Main Class>
```
1. **Game Version** the version id that the game is running. Currently 1.
2. **Mod Name** Your Mod Name
3. **Mod Version** The Version of Your Mod (Example: `1.0.0`)
4. **Main Class** Your Main Mod Class You Created in Step: 2.1 (Example: `imdaveead.someclicker.examplemod.ExampleMod`)
